# Quantitative Economics and Finance

Research projects that combine economic theory, financial market data and mathematical methods. Each project states a question, fixes its estimands before estimation, and reports results with their uncertainty and limitations.

| Project | Question | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [01 Crash insurance and the G10 carry premium](projects/01_fx_crash_insurance_carry/README.md) | Does the ex-ante price of crash insurance in FX option smiles explain the post-2008 collapse and 2022–2026 revival of the currency carry premium? | Estimation and robustness complete; paper in preparation |

## Layout

```
projects/<project>/   design, theory, data plan, log, reports
src/qef/              reusable code (FX conventions, pricing, smiles, data handling)
scripts/              acquisition and audit entry points
tests/                analytic and synthetic checks
cpp/                  compiled kernels (planned)
data/public/          attributed public snapshots (none yet)
data/private/         licensed data and derived values (not tracked)
```

## Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.lock && .venv/bin/pip install -e . --no-deps
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

LSEG Workspace data are acquired in a separate environment (`requirements-lseg.lock`). Running the acquisition and estimation requires the user's own LSEG licence; the repository contains no LSEG data. LSEG data are licensed for individual study and research and may not be redistributed. The repository therefore holds code, methods and aggregate results (means, standard errors, test statistics and intervals). It holds no LSEG data and no month-level series or calibrated parameters from which quotes could be reconstructed; these stay in `data/private/`, which Git ignores. Coverage facts (sample windows, counts) are published because they reveal no values. `tests/test_repository_hygiene.py` fails if a data extract or anything under `data/private/` is ever tracked.
